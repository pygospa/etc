# Checks latex source for common mistakes

dev-tex/chktex pcre -debug -doc

# debug		Enable extra debug codepaths, like asserts and extra output. If you want to get meaningful backtraces see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Quality_Assurance/Backtraces
# doc		Add extra documentation (API, Javadoc, etc). It is recommended to enable per package instead of globally
# pcre		Add support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
# test		Workaround to pull in packages needed to run with FEATURES=test. Portage-2.1.2 handles this internally, so don't set it in make.conf/package.use anymore
