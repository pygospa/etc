# cuda		Enable NVIDIA Cuda computations support
# doc		Add extra documentation (API, Javadoc, etc). It is recommended to enable per package instead of globally
# eigen		Enable usage of dev-cpp/eigen for computations
# examples	Install examples, usually source code
# ffmpeg	Enable ffmpeg/libav-based audio/video codec support
# gstreamer	Add support for media-libs/gstreamer (Streaming media)
# gtk		Add support for x11-libs/gtk+ (The GIMP Toolkit)
# ieee1394	Enable FireWire/iLink IEEE1394 support (dv, camera, ...)
# ipp		Enable Intel Integrated Primitive support
# java		Add support for Java
# jpeg		Add JPEG image support
# jpeg2k	Support for JPEG 2000, a wavelet-based image compression format
# libav		Prefer libav over ffmpeg whenever both are supported
# opencl	Add support for OpenCL
# openexr	Support for the OpenEXR graphics file format
# opengl	Add support for OpenGL (3D graphics)
# openmp	Build support for the OpenMP (support parallel computing), requires >=sys-devel/gcc-4.2 built with USE="openmp"
# pch		Enable precompiled header support for faster compilation at the expense of disk space and memory (>=sys-devel/gcc-3.4 only)
# png		Add support for libpng (PNG images)
# python	Add optional support/bindings for the Python language
# qt4		Add support for the Qt GUI/Application Toolkit version 4.x
# testprograms	Build and install programs for testing OpenCV (performance)
# threads	Add threads support for various packages. Usually pthreads
# tiff		Add support for the TIFF image format
# v4l		Enable support for video4linux (using linux-headers or userspace libv4l libraries)
# vtk		Build new 3D visualization module viz based on sci-libs/vtk
# xine		Add support for the XINE movie libraries
