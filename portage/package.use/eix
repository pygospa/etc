# debug		Build with upstream's CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS for debugging support; not recommended for normal use.
# dep		Make DEP=true the default which enables support for {,R,P}DEPEND but requires roughly double disk and memory.
# doc		Create description of the eix cache file additionally in html format
# nls		Add Native Language Support (using gettext - GNU locale utilities)
# optimization	Accept upstream's choices for CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS for optimization. Absense of this USE flag does not strip user's *FLAGS
# security	This adds some checks which can prevent certain exploits if e.g. the eix code has a bug. If you use the hardened toolchain, using this flag does not increase security and can even lead to problems.
# sqlite	Compile in support for portage's sqlite backend; to actually use it you need additional configuration of portage and eix
# strong-optimization 
#		Adds several more agressive CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS for optimization like graphite (if available). May cause trouble with some buggy compiler versions. Absense of this USE flag does not strip user's *FLAGS
# strong-security
#     		Add many checks to prevent exploits if eix code has a bug. This will slow down eix considerably. Use only if you are paranoid or have reasons to suspect a bug.
# swap-remote	Swap role of remote addresses in eix-remote, making the data from gpo.zugaina.org the first choice.
# tools		Create separate binary for script helper tools; useful if they are called extremely often
