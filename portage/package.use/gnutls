# bindist	Disallow building LZO support, because of a license incompatibility with dev-libs/lzo
# crywrap	Build the crywrap TLS proxy service
# cxx		Build support for C++ (bindings, extra libraries, code generation, ...)
# dane		Build libgnutls-dane, implementing DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities. Requires net-dns/unbound
# doc		Add extra documentation (API, Javadoc, etc). It is recommended to enable per package instead of globally
# examples	Install examples, usually source code
# guile		Add support for the guile Scheme interpreter
# lzo		Enable support for lzo compression
# nettle	Use dev-libs/nettle as crypto backend
# nls		Add Native Language Support (using gettext - GNU locale utilities)

# pkcs11	Add support for PKCS#11 through app-crypt/p11-kit
# static-libs	Build static versions of dynamic libraries as well
# test		Workaround to pull in packages needed to run with FEATURES=test. Portage-2.1.2 handles this internally, so don't set it in make.conf/package.use anymore
# tools		Build extra tools
# zlib		Add support for zlib (de)compression
