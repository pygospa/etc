dev-scheme/racket backtrace cairo doc futures jit -minimal places plot threads X

# backtrace	Support GC backtrace dumps
# cairo		Enable support for the cairo graphics library
# doc		Add extra documentation (API, Javadoc, etc). It is recommended to enable per package instead of globally
# futures	Enable racket/future library for fine-grained hardware parallelism
# jit		Enable just-in-time compilation for improved performance. May prevent use of some PaX memory protection features in Gentoo Hardened.
# minimal	Install a very minimal build (disables, for example, plugins, fonts, most drivers, non-critical features)
# places	Enable racket/place library for share-nothing parallelism and message-passing communication. Compared to futures, places are heavyweight, but they have a simpler performance model.
# plot		Enable plot libraries
# threads	Enable support for green threads
# X		Add support for X11
