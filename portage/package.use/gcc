# altivec	Add support for optimizations for G4 and G5/ppc970 processors
# awt		Useful only when building GCJ, this enables Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) peer support on top of GTK+
# boundschecking Add the bounds checking patch by Haj Ten Brugge, this will DISABLE the hardened PIE+SSP patches
# cilk		Support the Cilk Plus language (C/C++ based languages for parallel programming)
# cxx		Build support for C++ (bindings, extra libraries, code generation, ...)
# d		Enable support for the D programming language
# debug		Enable extra debug codepaths, like asserts and extra output. If you want to get meaningful backtraces see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Quality_Assurance/Backtraces
# doc		Add extra documentation (API, Javadoc, etc). It is recommended to enable per package instead of globally
# fixed-point	Enable fixed-point arithmetic support for MIPS targets in gcc (Warning: significantly increases compile time!)
# fortran 	Add support for fortran
# gcj		Enable building with gcj (The GNU Compiler for the Javatm Programming Language)
# go 		Build the GCC Go language frontend.
# graphite	Add support for the framework for loop optimizations based on a polyhedral intermediate representation
# hardened	Activate default security enhancements for toolchain (gcc, glibc, binutils)
# libssp 	Build SSP support into a dedicated library rather than use the code in the C library (DO NOT ENABLE THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES)
# mudflap	Add support for mudflap, a pointer use checking library
# multilib	On 64bit systems, if you want to be able to compile 32bit and 64bit binaries
# multislot	Allow for SLOTs to include minor version (3.3.4 instead of just 3.3)
# nls		Add Native Language Support (using gettext - GNU locale utilities)
# nopie		Disable PIE support (NOT FOR GENERAL USE)
# nossp		Disable SSP support (NOT FOR GENERAL USE)
# nptl 		Enable support for Native POSIX Threads Library, the new threading module (requires linux-2.6 or better usually)
# objc		Build support for the Objective C code language
# objc++	Build support for the Objective C++ language
# objc-gc	Build support for the Objective C code language Garbage Collector
# openmp	Build support for the OpenMP (support parallel computing), requires >=sys-devel/gcc-4.2 built with USE="openmp"
# sanitize	Build support various sanitizer functions (ASAN/TSAN/etc...)
# regression-test Run the testsuite and install the results (requires FEATURES=test)
# vanilla	Do not add extra patches which change default behaviour; DO NOT USE THIS ON A GLOBAL SCALE as the severity of the meaning changes drastically
